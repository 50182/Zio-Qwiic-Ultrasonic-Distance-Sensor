# Zio-Qwiic-Ultrasonic-Distance-Sensor

Description:



This is a Qwiic I2C version of ultrasonic sensor in our Qwiic family. TOF sensor is great, precise and fast, but this Ultrasonic sensor can provide wider detecting angle than TOF sensor and longer distance (3-400cm).


With this module we used a STM8 MCU as gateway to deal with sensor’s digital data in MCU, and send it out via I2C. So you don’t need to care about how it works inside the STM8, just trade it as an I2C device. In case you are interesting, you can check out the STM8 code at the bottom of the links.


We also breaked the serial pins just like the normal HC-SR04 module. The pins are not pre-soldered.
